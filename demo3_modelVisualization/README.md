### This is the third demo that visualizes the model using three different methods, averaging activation response, tweaking input image, and simplify images by removing superpixels while keeping the correct prediction.


To generate the figures in the paper, please simply run matlab files starting with "savefig". The "mat" files stores all the intermediate results from low-rank models. If you want to reproduce the results, please refer to file "main001...". A complete matconvnet toolbox will be included as another demo.

Please download model with this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxeylfSgpk1MOGNPZkxiWE1NUUU)

To visualize, please run "visualze...m" matlab functions.
