# Low-Rank-Bilinear-Pooling
--- Code, demo and model for our project of low rank bilinear pooling for fine-grained classification

checklist -- 
1. quick training using caffe, including matlab files for initialization;
2. hyperparameter study by low-rank and co-decomposition on the classifier parameters;
3. three methods of visualization
4. fine-tuning the network using matconvnet
5. TBA...
