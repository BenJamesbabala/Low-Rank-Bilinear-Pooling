### This is the second demo that shows the rationale of classifier low-rand factorization and co-decomposition, which enable us to use low-rank bilinear method for classification.

To generate the figures in the paper, please simply run matlab files starting with "savefig". The "mat" files store all the intermediate results from low-rank models. If you want to reproduce the results, please refer to file "main001...". A complete matconvnet toolbox will be included as another demo.
