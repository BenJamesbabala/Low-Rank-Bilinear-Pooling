a demo on how to train the low-rank bilinear pooling model, specifically, how to initialize the dimension-reduction layer using PCA, and how to initialize bisvm with random weights.

do not run ``main100_demo_PCA_conv53_forDimRed.m'' if your memory is not large enough. Of course this can be refined...

trying to make it self-contained.

a little messy, but will re-organize the folder in days:)
